## Realtalk

Ashet Technologies is the name of an art project by @MasterQ32 where they create retro-inspired technology, both software and hardware. There's no real company or anything behind this.

The project is about celebrating oldschool ways of doing things without ignoring what we've learnt in the past. Also it is meant to have a retro-wave/cyberpunkish aesthetic, so Ashet Technologies kinda behaves like a Megacorp.

If you want to contribute in one way or another, feel free to contact me on Discord (\@ikskuh) or via [personal mail](contact@ashet.computer).

Also thanks to OpenAI for generating all this corpo bullshit advertisment nonsense. I love it. It's so trash.
